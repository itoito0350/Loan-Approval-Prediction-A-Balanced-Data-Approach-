# Loan-Approval-Prediction-A-Balanced-Data-Approach
This project is focused on analyzing a dataset and applying machine learning models to generate predictions, classification reports, and visualizations.

## Overview
This project uses Python and several libraries (such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn) to analyze data, create machine learning models, and visualize key metrics. The primary goal of this project is to train models, evaluate their performance, and display the results in an interactive and easily understandable format.  
Key features:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Applying machine learning algorithms to build prediction models.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like AUC-ROC and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Displaying results through informative plots and tables.
